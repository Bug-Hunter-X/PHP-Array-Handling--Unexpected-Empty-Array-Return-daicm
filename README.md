# PHP Array Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to unexpected empty array returns in PHP when dealing with array processing functions.  The bug is difficult to reproduce consistently due to its dependence on specific error conditions within the processing function.

## Bug Description
A function designed to process an array sometimes returns an empty array unexpectedly.  This occurs under specific error scenarios within the function itself; the original array remains unchanged.  The unexpected empty array return makes debugging challenging. 

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the function always returns a copy of the array, preventing accidental modifications by reference. This makes the function's behavior predictable, regardless of any errors that might occur during processing.
